I write better in English, but will attempt to translate to Spanish and Nahuatl soon.  --Pablo/Paul

Nahuatl orthography still hasn't found a good standardization, mainly because
most people don't realize all the contrasts that should be shown.
Furthermore, different forms of Nahuatl have slightly different phonology.


One suggestion is currently at [[User talk:Netza]].  I see only one major problem with
Carochi's system: what happens when a long vowel precedes aspiration (I assume saltillo means aspiration here), as in ''pähtli'' (medicine)?  For that reason, and because aspiration behaves like syllable-final consonants, I recommend writing an 'h' or a 'j' for aspiration.


Here are general requirements I recommend for any writing in Nahuatl:

# Please distinguish between short and long vowels!  This can be done in a number of ways, most of which are probably acceptable:
#* Place a macron over long vowels, viz:  N&#257;watl.   This is the best looking, as macrons traditionally mark long vowels.  However, it is hard to typeset on any computer I've seen, so is inappropriate for (among other things) Wikis.
#* Place some other kind of mark over long vowels, viz: Näwatl  or  Nàwatl.  This is easier to typeset on most computers, especially Mexican computers.  This is a good solution.
#* Place an acute accent over long vowels, viz Náwatl.  This is almost as good, except that I've met native speakers of Nahuatl who think short vowels sound more like they have an accent.  So this is not quite as good as the other answers.
#* Place a colon immediately after a long vowel, viz Na:watl.  This is another good solution.
#* Write two of the long vowel, viz Naawatl.  This is a '''bad''' solution, because doubled vowels contrast against long vowels.  The first part of tlaalaxtik (''está liso'') is not like the first part of tlälli (''tierra'')
# I recommend never to use the word ''saltillo'' because it is used by some people to mean glottal stop, and by others to mean syllable-final aspiration.
# Syllable-final aspiration is just that.  It may affect the sound of the preceding vowel, but it acts just like any other syllable-final consonant, and should be marked with either an 'h' or a 'j' depending on your preference.
# Word-final aspiration is extremely confusing in Huasteca Nahuatl (and possibly in other Nahuatl languages).  I do not have a good answer for how to represent it, quite yet.
